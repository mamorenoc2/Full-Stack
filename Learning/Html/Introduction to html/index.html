                    <p>HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It's often the first language learned by developers,
                        marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work</p>
                    <p>HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos.
                        Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you'll see HTML in a panel of
                        your screen.</p>
                    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:</p>

                    <p>HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content. Let's
                        take a look at how they're written.</p>

                    <p>One of the key HTML elements we use to build a webpage is the body element. Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen. </p>
                    <p>Once the file has a body, many different types of content – including text, images, and buttons – can be added to the body.</p>

                <h2 class="section__title title-center">HTML Structure</h2>
                <p>HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the <strong>child</strong> of that element, The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.</p>
                <p>Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements is known as hierarchy.</p>
                <p>Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior and styling
                    from their
                    parent element</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="content content_str-heading">
                        <h3 class="section__subtitle">Heading <code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code> </h3> 
                        <p>Headings in HTML are similar to headings in other types of media. For example, in newspapers,
                            large
                            headings are typically used to capture a reader’s attention. Other times, headings are used
                            to
                            describe
                            content, like the title of a movie or an educational article.</p>
                        <p>HTML follows a similar pattern. In HTML, there are six different headings, or heading
                            elements.
                            Headings
                            can be used for a variety of purposes, like titling sections, articles, or other forms of
                            content.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content content_str-div">
                        <h3 class="section__subtitle">Divs <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></h3>
                        <p>One of the most popular elements in HTML because is a short for “division” or a container
                            that
                            divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful for grouping elements in your
                            HTML
                            together.</p>
                        <p> divs don’t inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to
                            apply
                            custom styles to our HTML elements. divs allow us to group HTML elements to apply the same
                            styles
                            for all HTML elements inside. We can also style the div element as a whole.</p>
                        <p> divs can contain any text or other HTML elements, such as links, images, or videos. Remember
                            to
                            always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of divs for better
                            readability.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="section__subtitle">Attributes <code>&lt;tag_name <strong>name="value"</strong>&gt;&lt;/tag_name&gt;</code></h3>
                        <p> Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several
                            different
                            ways, from providing information to changing styling. Attributes are made up of the name and
                            the
                            value. </p>
                        <p>One commonly used attribute is the id. We can use the id attribute to specify different
                            content (such
                            as divs) and is really helpful when you use an element more than once. ids have several
                            different
                            purposes in HTML, but for now, we’ll focus on how they can help us identify content on our
                            page.</p>

                        <p>The spacing between code in an HTML file doesn’t affect the positioning of elements in the
                            browser.
                            If you are interested in modifying the spacing in the browser, you can use HTML’s line break
                            element: <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>.</p>
                        <p>The line break element is unique because it is only composed of a starting tag. You can use
                            it
                            anywhere
                            within your HTML code and a line break will be shown in the browser.</p>

                <p>If you want to display text in HTML, you can use a paragraph or span:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <i class="fa fa-code"></i><strong>Paragraphs</strong> <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> contain a block of plain text</li>
                    <li> <i class="fa fa-code"></i><strong>Span</strong> <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of
                        content that
                        are on the same line as other content.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-code"></i><strong>em</strong> <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> emphasizes text</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-code"></i><strong>strong</strong> <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> highlights important text.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> <strong>Note</strong> It’s best to use a span element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is
                    inline, or
                    on the same line as other text. If you want to divide your content into blocks, it’s better to use a
                    div.

                <h3 class="section__subtitle">Unordered List</h3>
                <p>In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display content in an easy-to-read
                    list. In
                    HTML, you can use an unordered list tag <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> to create a list of items in no
                    particular
                    order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point.</p>

                <p>The <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element should not hold raw text and won’t automatically format raw text
                    into an
                    unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the
                    <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag. The<code>&lt;li&gt;</code> or list item tag is used to describe an item
                    in a
                    list.
                </p>

                <p>Ordered lists <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> are like unordered lists, except that each list item is
                    numbered. They
                    are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first to last. You
                    can
                    create the ordered list with the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag and then add individual list items to
                    the list

                        <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both
                            opening
                            and closing tags, but the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is a self-closing tag. Note that the end of
                            the
                            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag has a forward slash /. Self-closing tags may include or omit the final

                            both will render properly.

                        <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag has a <strong>required</strong> attribute called src. The src
                            attribute must
                            be set to the image’s source, or the location of the image. In this case, the value of src must be
                            the
                            uniform resource locator (URL) of the image. A URL is the web address or local address where a file

                <p>Part of being an exceptional web developer is making your site accessible to users of all

                    order to make the Web more inclusive, we need to consider what happens when assistive technologies
                    such as
                    screen readers come across image tags.</p>
                <p>The alt attribute, which means alternative text, brings meaning to the images on our sites. The alt
                    attribute
                    can be added to the image tag just like the src attribute. The value of alt should be a description
                    of the
                    image.</p>
                <p>The alt attribute also serves the following purposes:</p>

                    <li> <i class="fa fa-code"></i> If an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area originally intended for
                        the

                <h2>Links in HTML</h2>
                <p>One of the powerful aspects of HTML (and the Internet), is the ability to link to other web pages.
                    You can
                    add links to a web page by adding an anchor element ( a ) and including the text of the link in
                    between the
                    opening and closing tags.</p>
                <img src="/Learning/Html/Introduction to html/images/Link.PNG" alt="anchor link">
                <p>Wait a minute! Technically, the link in the example above is incomplete. How exactly is the link
                    above
                    supposed to work if there is no URL that will lead users to the actual Wikipedia page?. The anchor
                    element
                    in the example above is incomplete without the href attribute. This attribute stands for hyperlink
                    reference
                    and is used to link to a path, or the address to where a file is located (whether it is on your
                    computer or
                    another location). The paths provided to the href attribute are often URLs.</p>
                <img src="/Learning/Html/Introduction to html/images/Link href.PNG" alt="link href">
                <p>In the example above, the href attribute has been set to the value of the URL
                    https://www.wikipedia.org/. The
                    example now shows the correct use of an anchor element.</p>

                <h3>Open Links</h3>
                <p>Have you ever clicked on a link and observed the resulting web page open in a new browser window? If
                    so, you
                    can thank the ( a ) element’s target attribute. The target attribute specifies how a link should
                    open.</p>
                <p>For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. The target
                    attribute can
                    be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute</p>

                    alt="link anchor with blank target">

                <p>Thus far you have learned how to link to external web pages. Many sites also link to internal web
                    pages like
                    Home, About, and Contact. HTML files are often stored in the same folder, as shown in the example
                    above. If
                    the browser is currently displaying index.html, it also knows that about.html and contact.html are
                    in the
                    same folder. Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a
                    relative path.</p>
                <img src="/Learning/Html/Introduction to html/images/Link internal page.PNG"
                    alt="link anchor for internal pages">

                <p>You’ve probably visited websites where not all links were made up of text. Maybe the links you
                    clicked on
                    were images or some other form of content. HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by
                    wrapping that element with an anchor element. With this technique, it’s possible to turn images into
                    links
                    by simply wrapping the <img> element with an ( a ) element.</p>

                <h2>Tables in HTML</h2>
                <h3>Create a table</h3>
                <p>There are many websites on the Internet that display information like stock prices, sports scores,
                    invoice
                    data, and more. This data is tabular in nature, meaning that a table is often the best way of
                    presenting the
                    data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Before displaying data, we must first create the table that will contain the data by using
                            the (
                            table ) element.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Table rows:</h4>
                        <p> The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element: (
                            tr ).
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Table data:</h4>
                        <p>Rows aren’t sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined. In
                            HTML, you
                            can add data using the table data element: ( td )</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Table headings:</h4>
                        <p>Table data doesn’t make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents, to
                            add titles
                            to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: ( th )</p>

                        <p>For example, in this table a new row was added to hold the three headings: a blank heading, a
                            Saturday heading, and a Sunday heading. The blank heading creates the extra table cell
                            necessary to
                            align the table headings correctly over the data they correspond to.</p>
                        <p>In the second row, one table heading was added as a row title: Temperature</p>
                        <p>Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>row: This value makes it clear that the heading is for a row</li>
                            <li>col: This value makes it clear that the heading is for a column</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Spanning Columns</h4>
                        <p>What if the table contains data that spans multiple columns? For example, a personal calendar
                            could
                            have events that span across multiple hours, or even multiple days.</p>
                        <p>Data can span columns using the colspan attribute. The attribute accepts an integer (greater
                            than or
                            equal to 1) to denote the number of columns it spans across.</p>

                        <h4>Spanning rows</h4>
                        <p>Data can also span multiple rows using the rowspan attribute. The rowspan attribute is used
                            for data
                            that spans multiple rows (perhaps an event goes on for multiple hours on a certain day). It
                            accepts
                            an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of rows it spans across.</p>

                            using

                        <p>When a table’s body is sectioned off, however, it also makes sense to section off the table’s

                <h2>Semantic in HTML</h2>
                <p>When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic HTML and Semantic HTML. The word
                    semantic means
                    “relating to meaning,” so semantic elements provide information about the content between the
                    opening and
                    closing tags.</p>
                <p>By using Semantic HTML, we select HTML elements based on their meaning, not on how they are
                    presented.
                    Elements such as ( div ) and ( span) are not semantic elements since they provide no context as to
                    what is
                    inside of those tags.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Header</h3>
                        <p>Let’s take a look at some semantic elements that assist in the structure of a web page. A (
                            header )
                            is a
                            container usually for either navigational links or introductory content containing ( h1 ) to
                            ( h6 )
                            headings.</p>
                        <p>By using a (header) tag, our code becomes easier to read. It is much easier to identify what
                            is
                            inside of the
                            ( h1 )‘s parent tags, as opposed to a ( div ) tag which would provide no details as to what
                            was
                            inside of
                            the tag.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Nav</h3>
                        <p>A ( nav ) is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents.
                            It is
                            important to note that ( nav ) can be used inside of the ( header ) element but can also be
                            used on
                            its own.</p>

                        <h3>Main</h3>
                        <p>The element ( main ) is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag
                            is
                            separate from the ( footer ) and the ( nav ) of a web page since these elements don’t
                            contain the
                            principal content. By using ( main ) as opposed to a ( div ) element, screen readers and web
                            browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the
                            content.

                        <h3>Section</h3>
                        <p> ( section ) defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of
                            the
                            document with the same theme. For example, content with the same theme such as articles
                            about
                            cricket can go under a single ( section ). A website’s home page could be split into
                            sections for
                            the introduction, news items, and contact information.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Article</h3>
                        <p>The ( article ) element holds content that makes sense on its own. ( article ) can hold
                            content such
                            as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. An ( article ) tag would help someone using a
                            screen
                            reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text,
                            images,
                            audio, etc.) begins and ends.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Aside</h3>
                        <p>The ( aside ) element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element
                            but
                            isn’t required in order to understand the main content. This element can be used alongside
                            other
                            elements such a ( article ) or ( section ). Some common uses of the ( aside ) element are
                            for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bibliographies</li>
                            <li>Endnotes</li>
                            <li>Comments</li>
                            <li>Pull quotes</li>
                            <li>Editorial sidebars and Aditional information</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Figure</h3>
                        <p>The <code>&lt;figure&gt; </code> element used to encapsulate media such as an image,
                            illustration,
                            diagram, code snippet, etc, which is referenced in the main flow of the document.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="/Learning/Html/Introduction to html/images/Figure.PNG"
                                alt="Figure structure in HtML">
                        </figure>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It’s possible to add a caption to the image by using ( figcaption ) </li>
                            <p> ( figcaption ) is an element used to describe the media in the ( figure ) tag. Usually,
                                (
                                figcaption ) will go inside ( figure ). This is different than using a ( p ) element to
                                describe
                                the content; if we decide to change the location of ( figure ), the paragraph tag may
                                get
                                displaced from the figure while a ( figcaption ) will move with the figure. This is
                                useful for
                                grouping an image with a caption</p>
                        </ul>
